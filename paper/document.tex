\maketitle

\begin{abstract}\noindent
In this paper, we train Mozilla's DeepSpeech architecture in various ways on Mozilla's Common Voice German language speech dataset and compare the results. We build on previous efforts by \textcite{agarwal-zesch-2019-german} and reproduce their results by training the model from scratch. We improve upon these results by using an English pretrained version of DeepSpeech for weight initialization and experiment with the effects of freezing different layers during training.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The field of automatic speech recognition is dominated by research specific to English. There exist plenty available text-to-speech models pretrained on (and optimized for) the English language. When it comes to German, the range of available pretrained models becomes much sparser. In this paper, we train Mozilla's implementation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech}} of Baidu's DeepSpeech architecture \parencite{hannun2014deep} on German speech data. We use transfer learning to leverage the availability of a pretrained English version of DeepSpeech and observe the difference made by freezing different layers during training. The rationale for using transfer learning is not only that English and German are closely related languages. In fact, one could argue that they are very different in this context, because DeepSpeech is trained to directly infer written characters from audio data and English and German pronunciations of some characters differ greatly. However, the first few layers of the DeepSpeech network are likely not infering the final output character, but rather lower lever features of the spoken input, such as phonemes, which are shared across different languages. Thus this approach should also work for languages which are not related at all. It is to be expected that the model should give better results when trained on a small dataset than a model trained from scratch, because it does not have to learn these lower level features again.

\section{Training}
\subsection{DeepSpeech architecture}
Mozilla's DeepSpeech implementation differs in many ways from the original model presented in \parencite{hannun2014deep}. The architecture is described in detail in the official documentation\footnote{\url{https://deepspeech.readthedocs.io/en/latest/DeepSpeech.html}} and is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ds}. From the raw speech data, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients \parencite{imai1983cepstral} are extracted and passed to a 6-layer deep recurrent neural network. The first three layers are fully connected with a ReLU activation function. The fourth layer is a Long Short-Term Memory unit \parencite{hochreiter1997long}. The fifth layer is again fully connected and ReLU activated. The last layer outputs probabilites for each character in the language's alphabet. It is fully connected and uses a softmax activation for normalization. The character-probabilites are used to calculate a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function \parencite{graves2006connectionist}. The weights of the model are optimized using the Adam method \parencite{kingma2014adam} with respect to the CTC loss.

\subsection{Training Details} \label{sec:training}
In transfer learning, all weights of the model are initialized to those of the Enlish pretrained model, which is provided by Mozilla\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases}}. In addition to transfer learning, we also train the model from scratch with random weight initialization, thereby reproducing a result from \textcite{agarwal-zesch-2019-german}. In total, we train 6 different models:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The whole model from scratch ("Complete Training")
    \item The model with weights initialized to those of the English pretrained model ("Simple Transfer")
    \item The English-initialized model with the first layer frozen
    \item The English-initialized model with the first two layers frozen
    \item The English-initialized model with the first three layers frozen
    \item The English-initialized model with the first three and the fifth layer frozen
\end{enumerate}
We used Mozilla's DeepSpeech version 0.7.4 for training the model from scratch and version 0.7.3 for the transfer learning approach. The complete training script is available online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/onnoeberhard/deepspeech-paper/blob/master/training.sh}}. The modified versions of DeepSpeech that utilise layer freezing are also available online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/onnoeberhard/deepspeech-transfer}, the different versions with a different number of frozen layers are in the branches \emph{transfer-1}, \emph{\mbox{transfer-2}}, \emph{transfer} and \emph{\mbox{transfer-4}}.}. The weights were frozen by adding \texttt{trainable=False} at the appropriate places in the TensorFlow code. For all models, we had to reinitialize the last layer, because of the different alphabet sizes of German and English.

We trained the models on the German-language Mozilla Common Voice 2.0 speech dataset\footnote{\url{https://voice.mozilla.org/en/datasets}}. For inference and testing we used the language model KenLM \parencite{heafield-2011-kenlm}, trained on the corpus described in \parencite[Section 3.2]{Radeck-Arneth2015}. The text corpus consists of a mixture of text from the sources Wikipedia, Europarl and crawled sentences. The whole corpus was preprocessed with MaryTTS \parencite{schroder2003german} and cleaned in the same way as described in \parencite{agarwal-zesch-2019-german}. All these steps were chosen to be identical to \parencite{agarwal-zesch-2019-german}, such that comparison of results would be as meaningful as possible.

In training each model, we used a batch size of 24, a learning rate of 0.0005 and a dropout rate of 0.4. We did not perform any hyperparamter optimization. These hyperparameters, as well as those selected for traning the language model, differ from those chosen in \parencite{agarwal-zesch-2019-german}. This explains why our results differ even though the same model and training data was used. The training was done on a Linux machine with 96 Intel Xeon Platinum 8160 CPUs @ 2.10GHz, 256GB of memory and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU with 11GB of memory. Training each for 30 epochs took approximately one hour each.

\section{Results}
The test results from the six different models described in section \ref{sec:training} are compiled in table \ref{tab:results}. For testing, the epoch with the best validation loss during training was taken for each model. The last row is taken from \parencite[Table 3]{agarwal-zesch-2019-german} and describes only the result of training with the same data as we did. \textcite{agarwal-zesch-2019-german} achieved much better results when training on larger datasets. The difference between our result without transfer learning (WER 0.697) and theirs (0.797) likely stems from the difference in hyperparameters used. Figures \ref{fig:3c} and \ref{fig:4c} show the learning curves for all training procedures, with the green line (3 frozen layers) being the same in both plots. The epochs used for testing are also marked in the figures.

The best results were achieved by the model with the first three layers frozen during training. It is notable however, that the other three models that utilise layer freezing are not far off. The training curves look remarkably similar (see Figure~\ref{fig:4c}). All four models achieve much better results than the two models without layer freezing. The results seem to indicate that freezing the first layer brings the largest advanage in training, with diminishing returns on freezing the second and third layers. Additionally freezing the fifth layer slightly worsens the result.

The model with four frozen layer could only optimize the LSTM layer and the very last layer. It is surprising that it still achieves good results. It might be interesting to see what happens when the LSTM layer is frozen. It is probable that with a larger dataset the benefits of freezing weights decrease and better results are achieved with freezing fewer or no layers. However, for languages or dialects with little available training data this transfer learning approach seems promising.
